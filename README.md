https://drive.google.com/open?id=18eRvGAJ9UDzYauck5QLt3BGm9oYhze7w  :: The link to the google drive which contains the apk file.
The apk needs to be downloaded to the phone and thus is installed. The user can perform the tasks written as follows.

This is an ONLINE AUCTION APP, that is, you can send pictures of the items you want to be auctioned.
It is an AUTHENTICATED app. One can sign in to the app by using his/her email id and a password and then directly logging in.
If the user has already signed into the app than he/she can directly log in to the app.
The dashboard shows the live auctions that are being carried on.
It has a sign out button for the user to get logged out of the app.
The user can swipe right from the edge of the screen to open the navigation drawer which has the options for seeing the previous auctions and to create a new auction.
The user can start a new auction by selecting the photo of the item from the gallery.
The user needs to add a short description of the item, end time of the auction and the base bidding price. Clicking the ok button will upload all these informations to the firebase database and storage.
On clicking the item of the live auctions, it will display the details provided by the seller and the till-then highest bidder and bidding price.
The user can also check his history. There are still some construction activities in the app but the code is being compiled.
